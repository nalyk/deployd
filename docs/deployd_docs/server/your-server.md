## Deploying to your own Server

To deploy your app on your server, or on a cloud hosting service such as EC2 or Heroku, the server must support [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). 

Deployd also requires a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) database, which can be hosted on the same server or externally. 

If you have root shell access on the deployment server, you can install Deployd on it using the command `npm install -g deployd`. 
Otherwise, you will need to install Deployd as a dependency of your app itself using `npm install deployd` in the root directory of your app.

You can use the `dpd` CLI to run your server; this will start up an instance of MongoDB automatically, using the "data" folder. (Requires MongoDB installed on the server)

### Dashboard Access

To set up the dashboard on your server, type `dpd keygen` on your server's command line to create a remote access key. Type `dpd showkey` to get the key; you should store this somewhere secure.

You can then go to the `/dashboard` route on the server and type in that key to gain access.

### Server Script

Since Deployd is itself a node module, you can write your own scripts to run in production instead of using the command line interface. Read the [Building a Custom Run Script](/docs/server/run-script.md) Guide.

*Note: Some hosts do not support WebSockets, so `dpd.on()` may not work correctly on certain deployments.*
