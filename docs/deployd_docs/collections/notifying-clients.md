## Notifying the Client of Changes with Messages

Keeping all of the clients of your API up-to-date with your collection's latest data is simple with collection events. For example, in a `PUT` event, you can notify all connected clients of the changes to the object being updated by calling the [emit()](/docs/collections/reference/event-api.md#s-emit) function to send all connected users a message.

The `emit()` function takes an event argument and an arbitrary data object to send to all of the connected clients  (eg. `emit('my message', {foo: 'bar'})`). Dpd.js clients can listen for these events using the `on()` method (eg. `dpd.todos.on('my message', fn)`).

### Example

Let's say you want to make a chatroom app and you have a Collection called `/messages`. 

In the `On POST` event of `/messages`, you would add the following line:

    emit('messages:create', this);

This sends a message called `messages:create` (This could be anything) with the current object (`this`) as an argument. The `messages:` prefix namespaces the event to the collection.

On the client, you would listen for that event using `dpd.on()` and respond by updating the DOM:

    dpd.messages.on('create', function(message) {
      renderMessage(message);
    });

The `message` argument is the value you passed on the server (`this`).

See the [Chatroom Example](/docs/collections/examples/chatroom.md) for a working version of this code.
