## Querying Collections

### Simple Queries

Collections can be queried over HTTP using the query string.

This example will return all the `posts` with an author "Joe":

	GET /posts?author=Joe	


### Advanced Queries

When querying a [Collection](/docs/collections/), you can use special commands to create a more advanced query. 

Deployd supports all of [MongoDB's conditional operators](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries#AdvancedQueries-ConditionalOperators); only the common operators and Deployd's custom commands are documented here.

When using an advanced query in REST, you must pass JSON as the query string, for example:
	
	GET /posts?{"likes": {"$gt": 10}}

If you are using dpd.js, this will be handled automatically.

#### Comparison ($gt, $lt, $gte, $lte) <!-- api -->

Compares a Number property to a given value.

 - `$gt` - Greater than
 - `$lt` - Less than
 - `$gte` - Greater than or equal to
 - `$lte` - Less than or equal to

		// Finds all posts with more than 10 likes
		{
			likes: {$gt: 10}
		}

#### $ne (Not Equal) <!-- api -->

The `$ne` command lets you choose a value to exclude. 

	// Get all posts except those posted by Bob
	{
		author: {$ne: "Bob"}
	}

#### $in <!-- api -->

The `$in` command allows you to specify an array of possible matches.

	// Get articles in the "food", "business", and "technology" categories
	{
		category: {$in: ["food", "business", "technology"]}
	}

#### $regex <!-- api -->

The `$regex` command allows you to specify a [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) to match a string property.

You can also use the `$options` command to specify regular expression flags.

	// Get usernames that might be email addresses (x@y.z)
	{
		"username": {$regex: "[a-z0-9\-]+@[a-z0-9\-]+\.[a-z0-9\-]+", $options: 'i' }
	}

### Query commands

Query commands apply to the entire query, not just a single property.

#### $fields <!-- api -->

The `$fields` command allows you to include or exclude properties from your results.

    	// Exclude the "email" property
    	{
    		$fields: {email: 0}
    	}

<!--...-->

    	// Only include the "title" property
    	{
    		$fields: {title: 1}
    	}

#### $or <!-- api -->

The `$or` command allows you to specify multiple queries for an object to match in an array.

    // Get all public posts and all posts by a specified user (even if those are private)
    {
        $or: [{
          isPublic: true
        }, {
          creator: "Bob"
        }]
    }

#### $sort <!-- api -->

The `$sort` command allows you to order your results by the value of a property. The value can be 1 for ascending sort (lowest first; A-Z, 0-10) or -1 for descending (highest first; Z-A, 10-0)

    // Sort posts by likes, descending
    {
    	$sort: {likes: -1}
    }

#### $limit <!-- api -->

The `$limit` command allows you to limit the amount of objects that are returned from a query. This is commonly used for paging, along with `$skip`.

    // Return the top 10 scores
    {
    	$sort: {score: -1},
    	$limit: 10
    }

#### $skip <!-- api -->

The `$skip` command allows you to exclude a given number of the first objects returned from a query. This is commonly used for paging, along with `$limit`. 

	// Return the third page of posts, with 10 posts per page
	{
		$skip: 20,
		$limit: 10
	}
	
#### $limitRecursion <!-- api -->

The `$limitRecursion` command allows you to override the default recursive limits in Deployd. This is useful when you want to query a very deeply nested structure of data. Otherwise you can still query nested structures, but Deployd will stop the recursion after 2 levels. See the [Collection Relationships guide](/docs/collections/relationships-between-collections.md) for more info.
